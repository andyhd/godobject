Title: Pelican and Vimwiki
Summary: Behold my sticky tape and rubber bands
Friendly_Date: just before midnight on a rainy Thursday

I've managed to get [Pelican](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/) to work
with [Vimwiki](https://vimwiki.github.io/) so that I can publish my personal
wiki directly to this site. I'll explain here what I did, why, and how I did it.

# Why

I have never been a prolific (or noteworthy) writer, but every now and again I
feel like giving it a try. Over the years I have used various means of
publishing my drivel. Back in the day I claimed my [GeoCities]() address and put
up an embarrassing page about Kate Moss and Nine Inch Nails.  Later, I switched
to a [Blogger.com](https://www.blogger.com/) account, and posted little pieces
of nerdiness gathered from around the World Wide Web. Of course, as a
programmer, I wanted to write my own blog software. So I did. Over and over
again.

These days I don't have the time to repeatedly reinvent the wheel. Instead I
prefer to clumsily lash existing programs together to make a ramshackle raft of
software just good enough to get the job done. Just for myself, of course, not
for clients.

## Pelican

Recently I've been hearing a lot about [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/)
(Javascript, APIs and Markup), which proposes a way to build web sites using
client-side Javascript for dynamic functionality such as making requests to
APIs, and serving static HTML files rather than running web application software
that build pages on request. This fits quite nicely with my software MacGyver
ambitions, and I already have some experience with
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate static HTML for my personal site.

For no good reason other than tribalism, I wanted to use a Python based static
site generator instead of Jekyll. I found
[Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) which seems to support all of my current
requirements, being

1. Written in Python. Flimsy rationalization: I am comfortable with Python and I
   may want to write plugins
2. Handles [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). I don't want to learn another markup language.
3. I like pelicans.


## Vimwiki

I use [Vim]() for editing text. I've been using it for about 20 years and I just
can't be bothered to try anything else, so I won't bore you with the details of
[what makes Vim such a good editor](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1220118).

[Vimwiki]() is a handy plugin for Vim that provides an interface to treat a bunch of
text files as a [wiki](http://wiki.org/wiki.cgi?WhatIsWiki). Having a personal
offline wiki is a useful way of storing notes and ideas in an interlinked way,
rather like a [mind-map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map). These text
files can be in several formats, one of which is Markdown. Aha!


# How

Vimwiki and Pelican can both make use of Markdown files, so it is quite easy to
get them to work together.

First I created my Pelican blog:

    :::sh
    mkdir blog
    cd blog
    pelican-quickstart

This creates the following directory structure:

    :::sh
    blog/
      content/
      output/
      Makefile
      pelicanconf.py
      publishconf.py
      tasks.py

Pelican treats any Markdown file in the `content` directory as a
blog post. If you want non-blog pages (for example, an "About" page or a
contact form page), you can put them in `content/pages`.

By contrast, Vimwiki defaults to putting diary entries (which I want to be blog posts) in a
subdirectory called `diary` and non-diary pages in the wiki root directory.

As a compromise, I put posts and pages in sibling directories,
respectively `diary` and `pages`. 

I edited the `pelicanconf.py` file and added the
`ARTICLE_PATHS` setting, which is where it looks for blog post files:

    :::sh
    ARTICLE_PATHS = ['diary']

Then I added the Vimwiki settings in my `.vimrc` file:

    :::vim
    let g:vimwiki_list = [
        \ {'path': '~/blog/content/pages/',
            \ 'ext': '.md',
            \ 'syntax': 'markdown',
            \ 'diary_rel_path': '../',
        \ },
        \ {'path': '~/vimwiki'},
    \ ]

I left the default Vimwiki in the list, as it allows multiple wikis.

Finally, to enable wiki links, I installed a Markdown extension:

    :::sh
    pip install mdx_wikilink_plus

and configured it in `pelicanconf.py`:

    :::python
    MARKDOWN = {
        "extension_configs": {
            "mdx_wikilink_plus": {
                "base_url": "/pages",
            },
            "markdown.extensions.codehilite": {
                "css_class": "highlight",
            },
            "markdown.extensions.extra": {},
            "markdown.extensions.meta": {},
        },
        "output_format": "html5",
    }

# So What

This setup allows me to start a new blog post in Vim with `\w\w` . I can write
in Markdown and have Pelican convert it to HTML and even push it to [Github
Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

I can use `[[wiki-links]]` to link pages and both use them in Vim and generate working
links on my website.

All without writing a line of code and just editing a couple of configuration files.

It certainly beats writing, quickly tiring of, rewriting, finessing and
eventually abandoning yet another blog application. Now I have more time to get
good at writing.
